Basic information needed to develop models will apear here. 

Every model in TCLB is defined by a subdirectory of `models`.
The `conf.mk` file stores some additional settings for a model, but it also tells TCLB that this directory is in fact a model.

#General information

2 most important files: Dynamics.c and Dynamics.R, what goes where(logic, settings, quantities)

#conf.mk

#Dynamics.R

File structure, what are quantities, globals, etc, whats needed in (almost) every model

#Dynamics.C

File structure, what goes where etc.

#Advanced concepts

Extracting values, calculating forces (TODO: co jeszcze?)
